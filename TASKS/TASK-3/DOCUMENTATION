SEGMENTATION MAPS OF LANES

APPROACH:
- High Illumination Images are taken as input, followed  by conversion to grayscale
- A gaussian blur is applied to smoothen the image and reduce noise (reason being, allowing noise to persist causes issues in edge detection)
- Next, Canny Edge detection method is used to obtain the edges of the images
- Now, a polygonal mask is created which is implemented onto the canny image to obtain the lane of the image
- The contours on the image is found to implement a bright colour on to the lanes and dark colour on the rest of the image
leftover:
- Colouring every pixel of the lane as bright, and the rest dark

GAMMA CORRECTION

APPROACH:
> The papers used : 
    { https://www.researchgate.net/publication/214781523_Understanding_the_Gamma_Adjustment_of_Images
    { An adaptive gamma correction for image enhancement - Shanto Rahman, Md Mostafijur Rahman, M. Abdullah-Al-Wadud, Golam Dastegir Al-Quaderi & Mohammad Shoyaib 
- Transformation formula -- O = I^(gamma) : O is output image, I is input image and gamma is the correction factor
- If gamma is greater than 1, the Output image has lower brightness whereas when gamma is lesser than 1 the Output image has higher brightness
- Using logarithmic transformations, we input the lower brightness and higher brightness image to obtain the value of gamma
- After this, the corresponding gamma is inversed to convert the higher brightness images into the lower brightness images
