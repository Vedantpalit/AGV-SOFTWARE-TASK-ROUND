APPROACH:
> Sources studied from : https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2gX-ftPVXU3oUFNATxGXY90AULiqnWT
- Initiated the program, by reading the text file into a dataframe using pandas
- After the dataframe is created, consisting of x_position,y_position,x_velocity,y_velocity
- The Kalman Filter Algorithm is applied: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lj2iEP5cV-4DJrSN6FM81m_tShEDSvs0/view?usp=sharing ) - further explanation here
- The updated state matrix is added to a new empty dataframe
- From the updated state matrix,the new positions in the x-direction and y-direction are printed along with the x-velocities and y-velocities
- The values of the uncertainties in position and velocities are also printed for every iteration
