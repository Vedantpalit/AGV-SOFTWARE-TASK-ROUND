TASK 2 --
  A| 2-D LINE FITTING
  B| IMAGE STITCHING


2-D Line Fitting:

APPROACH:
 - The Black dots are detected as keypoints using an ORB detector from the grayscaled image, and the coordinates are retrieved (One possible fallacy - multiple keypoints detected in the same region)
 - The coordinates are stored in two arrays of x-coordinates and y-coordinates
 - Using LinearRegression from sklearn in an attempt to find best fit line, however the best fit line is not found
 - Using ransac from skimage to use the RANSAC Regression on the given scatter plot
 - From the RANSAC algorithm - log[(1-p)/(1-(1-e)^s)]= T, so T is the number of trials needed to find the robust line, 1-e: inlier ratio , p is probability of atleast one random sample free from outliers
 - Using 1-e as 0.7, s as 4, with a target to obtain p as 99.99%, we obtain the number T as 26.
 - So in the ransac function, we set the above as the needed parameters to get to the best fit line
 - The line is then plotted on the original scatter plot

Image Stitching:

Used Two approaches to do the stitching: K-Nearest Neighbour Method and Brute Force Matching

Common approach:
 - The two halves of the images are read together and converted to grayscale
 - To find the points to be matched, the SIFT detector is used to detect the keypoints of the images
 - Following this two approaches are used ----
 KNN approach: The K- Nearest Neighbour Approach matches similar keypoints in one images to K keypoints in the other image
 - In program, k=2 is used so there is one best match, and one second best match
 - Using Lowe's ratio test where ratio is taken as 0.5, the best knn matches are found and added to an array
 - KnnMatcher is used to draw the correlations from image 1 to image 2
 - Following this, the Homography matrix is calculated with 8 degrees of freedom using the findHomography function
 - The Homography matrix to transform image 2 to the plane of image 1, followed by resizing to obtain a properly stitched image
 BRUTE FORCE approach : Correlations are made from all similar keypoints to all similar keypoints from image 1 to image 2
 - The Homography matrix is calculated by this method following by the transformations to obtain the stitched image.
