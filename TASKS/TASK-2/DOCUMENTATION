TASK 2 --
  A| 2-D LINE FITTING
  B| IMAGE STITCHING


2-D Line Fitting:

APPROACH:
 - The Black dots are detected as keypoints using an ORB detector, and the coordinates are retrieved (One possible fallacy - multiple keypoints detected in the same region)
 - The coordinates are stored in two arrays of x-coordinates and y-coordinates
 - Using LinearRegression from sklearn in an attempt to find best fit line, however the best fit line is not found
 - Using ransac from skimage to use the RANSAC Regression on the given scatter plot
 -
