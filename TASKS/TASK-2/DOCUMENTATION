TASK 2 --
  A| 2-D LINE FITTING
  B| IMAGE STITCHING


2-D Line Fitting:

APPROACH:
 - The Black dots are detected as keypoints using an ORB detector, and the coordinates are retrieved (One possible fallacy - multiple keypoints detected in the same region)
 - The coordinates are stored in two arrays of x-coordinates and y-coordinates
 - Using LinearRegression from sklearn in an attempt to find best fit line, however the best fit line is not found
 - Using ransac from skimage to use the RANSAC Regression on the given scatter plot
 - From the RANSAC algorithm - log[(1-p)/(1-(1-e)^s)]= T, so T is the number of trials needed to find the robust line, 1-e: inlier ratio , p is probability of atleast one random sample free from outliers
 - Using 1-e as 0.7, s as 4, with a target to obtain p as 99.99%, we obtain the number T as 26.
 - So in the ransac function, we set the above as the needed parameters to get to the best fit line
 - The line is then plotted on the original scatter plot
